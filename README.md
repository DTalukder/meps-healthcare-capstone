# MEPS Healthcare Cost Prediction – Capstone Project

This capstone project explores patterns in U.S. healthcare spending using the 2022 Full-Year Consolidated Data File (HC-243) from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). 

The objective is to identify key cost drivers and analyze how demographics, insurance types, and medical conditions influence healthcare expenditures.

## Project Breakdown

- Proposal: Defined the problem — unpredictable and rising healthcare costs.
- Literature Review: Summarize findings from 6 relevant studies.
- Dataset: MEPS HC-243 (22,431 rows × 1,420 columns).
- EDA: Cleaned and explored the dataset.
- Next Steps: Predictive modeling.

## Coming Soon

- `eda_notebook.ipynb` – Exploratory Data Analysis (done, file too large to upload)
- `modeling_notebook.ipynb` – Predictive modeling (in progress)
- `meps_cleaned.csv` – Cleaned dataset for modelingm (done, file too large to upload)
