# MEPS Healthcare Cost Prediction – Capstone Project

This capstone project explores patterns in U.S. healthcare spending using the 2022 Full-Year Consolidated Data File (HC-243) from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). 

The goal is to **predict total healthcare expenditure** (`TOTEXP22`) and **identify key cost drivers** such as insurance types, income level, and demographics.

## Project Overview

- **Problem**: Unpredictable and rising healthcare costs in the U.S.
- **Objective**: Predict `TOTEXP22` (Total Expenditure) using machine learning and extract insights on what drives high healthcare spending.
- **Dataset**: MEPS HC-243 (22,431 rows × 1,420 features)

## Project Steps

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1. Project Proposal | Defined the problem and approach |
| 2. Literature Review | Summarized 6+ peer-reviewed studies |
| 3. Dataset Description | Provided breakdown of MEPS HC-243 |
| 4. EDA | Cleaned, explored, and visualized the data |
| 5. Feature Engineering | Selected key predictors, handled skewed values |
| 6. Modeling | Trained and evaluated multiple ML models |
| 7. Interpretation | Used feature importances to explain predictions |
| 8. GitHub Deployment | Uploaded code, data, and project structure |


## Modeling Results

| Model               | MAE     | RMSE     | R²     |
|--------------------|---------|----------|--------|
| Linear Regression  | 204.33  | 1,438.71 | 0.9943 |
| Decision Tree      | 988.88  | 9,211.89 | 0.7648 |
| Random Forest      | 661.07  | 4,248.95 | 0.9500 |
| Gradient Boosting  | 749.48  | 3,838.15 | 0.9592 |
| XGBoost            | 948.92  | 7,949.97 | 0.8249 |

>  **Best model**: Gradient Boosting (balanced performance + interpretation)

## Feature Importances (Gradient Boosting)

The top predictors of healthcare costs included:
- **TOTPTR22**: Total private third-party payments
- **TOTMCR22**: Medicare payments
- **TOTMCD22**: Medicaid payments
- **TOTPRV22**: Total private insurance
- **TOTSLF22**: Out-of-pocket/self-pay
